      "An **apple** is a round, edible fruit produced by an **apple tree** (_Malus spp._, among them the **domestic** or **orchard apple** ; _**Malus domestica**_). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus _Malus_. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, _Malus sieversii_ , is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia and were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition. \n",
      "Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. For commercial purposes, including botanical evaluation, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting. \n",
      "There are more than 7,500 cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider or apple juice production. Trees and fruit are prone to fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production. \n",
      "## Etymology\n",
      "The word _apple_ , whose Old English ancestor is _æppel_ , is descended from the Proto-Germanic noun *_aplaz_ , descended in turn from Proto-Indo-European *_h₂ébōl_.[3] As late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit, including nuts. This can be compared to the 14th-century Middle English expression _appel of paradis_ , meaning a banana.[4]\n",
      "## Description\n",
      "The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 metres (6 to 15 feet) tall in cultivation and up to 15 m (49 ft) in the wild, though more typically 2 to 10 m (6.5 to 33 ft).[5][1] When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by rootstock selection and trimming method.[5] Apple trees may naturally have a rounded to erect crown with a dense canopy of leaves.[6] The bark of the trunk is dark gray or gray-brown, but young branches are reddish or dark-brown with a smooth texture.[1][7] Young twigs are covered in fine downy hairs; they become hairless when older.[7]\n",
      "The buds are egg-shaped and dark red or purple in color; they range in size from 3 to 5 millimeters, but are usually less than 4 mm. The bud scales have very hairy edges. When emerging from the buds, the leaves are convolute, meaning that their edges overlap each other.[1] Leaves can be simple ovals (elliptic), medium or wide in width, somewhat egg-shaped with the wider portion toward their base (ovate), or even with sides that are more parallel to each other instead of curved (oblong) with a narrow pointed end.[7][1] The edges have broadly-angled teeth, but do not have lobes. The top surface of the leaves are glabrescent, almost hairless, while the undersides are densely covered in fine hairs.[1] The leaves are attached alternately by short leaf stems 1-to-3.5 cm (1⁄2-to-1+1⁄2 in) long.[6][1]\n",
      "Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced on spurs and some long shoots.[5] When the flower buds first begin to open the petals are rose-pink and fade to white or light pink when fully open with each flower 3-to-4-centimeter (1-to-1+1⁄2-inch) in diameter.[1] The five-petaled flowers are group in an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 3–7 flowers.[8] The central flower of the inflorescence is called the \"king bloom\"; it opens first and can develop a larger fruit.[6] Open apple blossoms are damaged by even brief exposures to temperatures −2 °C (28 °F) or less, although the overwintering wood and buds are hardy down to −40 °C (−40 °F).[8]\n",

      "The fruit is a pome that matures in late summer or autumn.[1] The true fruits or carpels are the harder interior chambers inside the apple's core. There are usually five carpels inside an apple, but there may be as few as three. Each of the chambers contains one or two seeds.[9] The edible flesh is formed from the receptacle at the base of the flower.[10]\n",

      "The size of the fruit varies widely between cultivars, but generally has a diameter between 2.5 and 12 cm (1 and 5 in).[7] The shape is quite variable and may be nearly round, elongated, conical, or short and wide.[12]\n",
      "The groundcolor of ripe apples is yellow, green, yellow-green or whitish yellow. The overcolor of ripe apples can be orange-red, pink-red, red, purple-red or brown-red. The overcolor amount can be 0–100%.[13] The skin may be wholly or partly russeted, making it rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax.[14] The skin may also be marked with scattered dots.[1] The flesh is generally pale yellowish-white, though it can be pink, yellow or green.[13]\n",

      "## Taxonomy\n",
      "The apple as a species has more than 100 alternative scientific names, or synonyms.[17] In modern times, _Malus pumila_ and _Malus domestica_ are the two main names in use. _M. pumila_ is the older name, but _M. domestica_ has become much more commonly used starting in the 21st century, especially in the western world. Two proposals were made to make _M. domestica_ a conserved name: the earlier proposal was voted down by the Committee for Vascular Plants of the IAPT in 2014, but in April 2017 the Committee decided, with a narrow majority, that the newly popular name should be conserved.[18] The General Committee of the IAPT decided in June 2017 to approve this change, officially conserving _M. domestica_.[19] Nevertheless, some works published after 2017 still use _M. pumila_ as the correct name, under an alternate taxonomy.[2]\n",
      "When first classified by Linnaeus in 1753, the pears, apples, and quinces were combined into one genus that he named _Pyrus_ and he named the apple as _Pyrus malus_. This was widely accepted, however the botanist Philip Miller published an alternate classification in The Gardeners Dictionary with the apple species separated from _Pyrus_ in 1754. He did not clearly indicate that by _Malus pumila_ he meant the domesticated apple. Nonetheless, it was used as such by many botanists. When Moritz Balthasar Borkhausen published his scientific description of the apple in 1803 it may have been a new combination of _P. malus_ var. _domestica_ , but this was not directly referenced by Borkhausen.[17] The earliest use of var. _domestica_ for the apple was by Georg Adolf Suckow in 1786.[2]\n",
      "### Genome\n",
      "Further information: Apple genome\n",
      "Apples are diploid, with two sets of chromosomes per cell (though triploid cultivars, with three sets, are not uncommon), have 17 chromosomes and an estimated genome size of approximately 650 Mb. Several whole genome sequences have been completed and made available. The first one in 2010 was based on the diploid cultivar 'Golden Delicious'.[20] However, this first whole genome sequence contained several errors,[21] in part owing to the high degree of heterozygosity in diploid apples which, in combination with an ancient genome duplication, complicated the assembly. Recently, double- and trihaploid individuals have been sequenced, yielding whole genome sequences of higher quality.[22][23]\n",
      "The first whole genome assembly was estimated to contain around 57,000 genes,[20] though the more recent genome sequences support estimates between 42,000 and 44,700 protein-coding genes.[22][23] The availability of whole genome sequences has provided evidence that the wild ancestor of the cultivated apple most likely is _Malus sieversii_. Re-sequencing of multiple accessions has supported this, while also suggesting extensive introgression from _Malus sylvestris_ following domestication.[24]\n",

The wild origin is in Kazakhstan; hybridisations and repeated domestications followed, modifying many attributes of the fruit.[24] ![color photograph of a hand holding a red apple](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/95apple.jpeg/220px-95apple.jpeg)Wild _Malus sieversii_ apple in Kazakhstan\n",
      "Central Asia is generally considered the center of origin for apples due to the genetic variability in specimens there.[25] The wild ancestor of _Malus domestica_ was _Malus sieversii_ , found growing wild in the mountains of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and northwestern China.[5][26] Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed over a long period of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with _Malus sylvestris_ , the crabapple, resulted in populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor _Malus sieversii_. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.[27][28][29]\n",
      "The apple is thought to have been domesticated 4,000–10,000 years ago in the Tian Shan mountains, and then to have travelled along the Silk Road to Europe, with hybridization and introgression of wild crabapples from Siberia (_M. baccata_), the Caucasus (_M. orientalis_), and Europe (_M. sylvestris_). Only the _M. sieversii_ trees growing on the western side of the Tian Shan mountains contributed genetically to the domesticated apple, not the isolated population on the eastern side.[24]\n",
      "Chinese soft apples, such as _M. asiatica_ and _M. prunifolia_ , have been cultivated as dessert apples for more than 2,000 years in China. These are thought to be hybrids between _M. baccata_ and _M. sieversii_ in Kazakhstan.[24]\n",
      "Among the traits selected for by human growers are size, fruit acidity, color, firmness, and soluble sugar. Unusually for domesticated fruits, the wild _M. sieversii_ origin is only slightly smaller than the modern domesticated apple.[24]\n",
      "At the Sammardenchia-Cueis site near Udine in Northeastern Italy, seeds from some form of apples have been found in material carbon dated to between 6570 and 5684 BCE.[30] Genetic analysis has not yet been successfully used to determine whether such ancient apples were wild _Malus sylvestris_ or _Malus domesticus_ containing _Malus sieversii_ ancestry. It is hard to distinguish in the archeological record between foraged wild apples and apple plantations.[31]\n",
      "There is indirect evidence of apple cultivation in the third millennium BCE in the Middle East.[31] There is direct evidence, apple cores, dated to the 10th century BCE from a Judean site between the Sinai and Negev. [32] There was substantial apple production in European classical antiquity, and grafting was certainly known then.[31] Grafting is an essential part of modern domesticated apple production, to be able to propagate the best cultivars; it is unclear when apple tree grafting was invented.[31]\n",

      "The Roman writer Pliny the Elder describes a method of storage for apples from his time in the 1st century. He says they should be placed in a room with good air circulation from a north facing window on a bed of straw, chaff, or mats with windfalls kept separately.[33] Though methods like this will extend the availabity of reasonably fresh apples, without refrigeration their lifespan is limited. Even sturdy winter apple varieties will only keep well until December in cool climates.[34] For longer storage medieval Europeans strung up cored and peeled apples to dry, either whole or sliced into rings.[35]\n",
      "Of the many Old World plants that the Spanish introduced to Chiloé Archipelago in the 16th century, apple trees became particularly well adapted.[36] Apples were introduced to North America by colonists in the 17th century,[5] and the first named apple cultivar was introduced in Boston by Reverend William Blaxton in 1640.[37] The only apples native to North America are crab apples.[38]\n",
      "Apple cultivars brought as seed from Europe were spread along Native American trade routes, as well as being cultivated on colonial farms. An 1845 United States apples nursery catalogue sold 350 of the \"best\" cultivars, showing the proliferation of new North American cultivars by the early 19th century.[38] In the 20th century, irrigation projects in Eastern Washington began and allowed the development of the multibillion-dollar fruit industry, of which the apple is the leading product.[5]\n",
      "Until the 20th century, farmers stored apples in frostproof cellars during the winter for their own use or for sale. Improved transportation of fresh apples by train and road replaced the necessity for storage.[39][40] Controlled atmosphere facilities are used to keep apples fresh year-round. Controlled atmosphere facilities use high humidity, low oxygen, and controlled carbon dioxide levels to maintain fruit freshness. They were first researched at Cambridge University in the 1920s and first used in the United States in the 1950s.[41]\n",

      "Many apples grow readily from seeds. However, apples must be propagated asexually to obtain cuttings with the characteristics of the parent. This is because seedling apples are \"extreme heterozygotes\". Rather than resembling their parents, seedlings are all different from each other and from their parents.[42] Triploid cultivars have an additional reproductive barrier in that three sets of chromosomes cannot be divided evenly during meiosis, yielding unequal segregation of the chromosomes (aneuploids). Even in the case when a triploid plant can produce a seed (apples are an example), it occurs infrequently, and seedlings rarely survive.[43]\n",
      "Because apples are not true breeders when planted as seeds, propagation usually involves grafting of cuttings. The rootstock used for the bottom of the graft can be selected to produce trees of a large variety of sizes, as well as changing the winter hardiness, insect and disease resistance, and soil preference of the resulting tree. Dwarf rootstocks can be used to produce very small trees (less than 3.0 m or 10 ft high at maturity), which bear fruit many years earlier in their life cycle than full size trees, and are easier to harvest.[44]\n",
      "Dwarf rootstocks for apple trees can be traced as far back as 300 BCE, to the area of Persia and Asia Minor. Alexander the Great sent samples of dwarf apple trees to Aristotle's Lyceum. Dwarf rootstocks became common by the 15th century and later went through several cycles of popularity and decline throughout the world.[45] The majority of the rootstocks used to control size in apples were developed in England in the early 1900s. The East Malling Research Station conducted extensive research into rootstocks, and their rootstocks are given an \"M\" prefix to designate their origin. Rootstocks marked with an \"MM\" prefix are Malling-series cultivars later crossed with trees of 'Northern Spy' in Merton, England.[46]\n",
      "Most new apple cultivars originate as seedlings, which either arise by chance or are bred by deliberately crossing cultivars with promising characteristics.[47] The words \"seedling\", \"pippin\", and \"kernel\" in the name of an apple cultivar suggest that it originated as a seedling. Apples can also form bud sports (mutations on a single branch). Some bud sports turn out to be improved strains of the parent cultivar. Some differ sufficiently from the parent tree to be considered new cultivars.[48]\n",
      "Apples have been acclimatized in Ecuador at very high altitudes, where they can often, with the needed factors, provide crops twice per year because of constant temperate conditions year-round.[49]\n",

Honey bees are most commonly used. Orchard mason bees are also used as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. Bumblebee queens are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in sufficient number to be significant pollinators.[48][50]\n",

      "Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock. Some cultivars, if left unpruned, grow very large—letting them bear more fruit, but making harvesting more difficult. Depending on tree density (number of trees planted per unit surface area), mature trees typically bear 40–200 kg (90–440 lb) of apples each year, though productivity can be close to zero in poor years. Apples are harvested using three-point ladders that are designed to fit amongst the branches. Trees grafted on dwarfing rootstocks bear about 10–80 kg (20–180 lb) of fruit per year.[48]\n",

      "Commercially, apples can be stored for months in controlled atmosphere chambers. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with lowered concentrations of oxygen to reduce respiration and slow softening and other changes if the fruit is already fully ripe. The gas ethylene is used by plants as a hormone which promotes ripening, decreasing the time an apple can be stored. For storage longer than about six months the apples are picked earlier, before full ripeness, when ethylene production by the fruit is low. However, in many varieties this increases their sensitivity to carbon dioxide, which also must be controlled.[53]\n",
      "For home storage, most culitvars of apple can be stored for three weeks in a pantry and four to six weeks from the date of purchase in a refrigerator that maintains 4 to 0 °C (39 to 32 °F).[54][55] Some varieties of apples (e.g. 'Granny Smith' and 'Fuji') have more than three times the storage life of others.[56]\n",

      "Apple trees are susceptible to fungal and bacterial diseases, and to damage by insect pests. Many commercial orchards pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. Organic methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest. \n",
      "A wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant. Three of the more common diseases or pests are mildew, aphids, and apple scab. \n",
      "  * Mildew is characterized by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and flowers, normally in spring. The flowers turn a creamy yellow color and do not develop correctly. This can be treated similarly to _Botrytis_—eliminating the conditions that caused the disease and burning the infected plants are among recommended actions.[58]\n",
      "  * Aphids are small insects with sucking mouthparts. Five species of aphids commonly attack apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid, and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species can be identified by color, time of year, and by differences in the cornicles (small paired projections from their rear).[59] Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.[60]\n",
      "  * Apple scab: Apple scab causes leaves to develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture. The disease also affects the fruit, which also develops similar brown spots with velvety or cork-like textures. Apple scab is spread through fungus growing in old apple leaves on the ground and spreads during warm spring weather to infect the new year's growth.[61]\n",

      "\n",
      "Among the most serious disease problems is a bacterial disease called fireblight, and three fungal diseases: _Gymnosporangium_ rust, black spot,[62] and bitter rot.[63] Codling moths, and the apple maggots of fruit flies, cause serious damage to apple fruits, making them unsaleable. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.[61] The larvae of the apple clearwing moth (red-belted clearwing) burrow through the bark and into the phloem of apple trees, potentially causing significant damage.[64]\n",

The UK's National Fruit Collection, which is the responsibility of the Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, includes a collection of over 2,000 cultivars of apple tree in Kent.[67] The University of Reading, which is responsible for developing the UK national collection database, provides access to search the national collection. The University of Reading's work is part of the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources of which there are 38 countries participating in the Malus/Pyrus work group.[68]\n",
      "The UK's national fruit collection database contains much information on the characteristics and origin of many apples, including alternative names for what is essentially the same \"genetic\" apple cultivar. Most of these cultivars are bred for eating fresh (dessert apples), though some are cultivated specifically for cooking (cooking apples) or producing cider. Cider apples are typically too tart and astringent to eat fresh, but they give the beverage a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.[69]\n",
      "In the United States there are many apple breeding programs associated with universities. Cornell University has had a program operating since 1880 in Geneva, New York. Among their recent well known apples is the 'SnapDragon' cultivar released in 2013. In the west Washington State University started a program to support their apple industry in 1994 and released the 'Cosmic Crisp' cultivar in 2017. The third most grown apple cultivar in the United States is the 'Honeycrisp', released by the University of Minnesota program in 1991.[70] Unusually for a popular cultivar, the 'Honeycrisp' is not directly related to another popular apple cultivar but instead to two unsuccessful cultivars.[71] In Europe there are also many breeding programs such as the Julius Kühn-Institut, the German federal research center for cultivated plants.[72]\n",
      "Commercially popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp. Other desirable qualities in modern commercial apple breeding are a colorful skin, absence of russeting, ease of shipping, lengthy storage ability, high yields, disease resistance, common apple shape, and developed flavor.[66] Modern apples are generally sweeter than older cultivars, as popular tastes in apples have varied over time. Most North Americans and Europeans favor sweet, subacid apples, but tart apples have a strong minority following.[73] Extremely sweet apples with barely any acid flavor are popular in Asia,[73] especially the Indian subcontinent.[69]\n",

      "Old cultivars are often oddly shaped, russeted, and grow in a variety of textures and colors. Some find them to have better flavor than modern cultivars, but they may have other problems that make them commercially unviable—low yield, disease susceptibility, poor tolerance for storage or transport, or just being the \"wrong\" size.[74] A few old cultivars are still produced on a large scale, but many have been preserved by home gardeners and farmers that sell directly to local markets. Many unusual and locally important cultivars with their own unique taste and appearance exist; apple conservation campaigns have sprung up around the world to preserve such local cultivars from extinction. In the United Kingdom, old cultivars such as 'Cox's Orange Pippin' and 'Egremont Russet' are still commercially important even though by modern standards they are low yielding and susceptible to disease.[5]\n",

      "## Toxicity\n",
      "### Amygdalin\n",
      "Apple seeds contain small amounts of amygdalin, a sugar and cyanide compound known as a cyanogenic glycoside. Ingesting small amounts of apple seeds causes no ill effects, but consumption of extremely large doses can cause adverse reactions. It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be hydrolyzed before the cyanide ion is released.[76] The U.S. National Library of Medicine's Hazardous Substances Data Bank records no cases of amygdalin poisoning from consuming apple seeds.[77]\n",
      "### Allergy\n",
      "One form of apple allergy, often found in northern Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen.[78] Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples that is similar to birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail oral allergy syndrome (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat,[78] but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis.[79] This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.[78]\n",
      "In other areas, such as the Mediterranean, some individuals have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches.[78] This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals cannot eat raw or cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have the highest levels of the protein that causes this reaction.[78]\n",
      "Breeding efforts have yet to produce a hypoallergenic fruit suitable for either of the two forms of apple allergy.[78]\n",

      "Apples are milled or pressed to produce apple juice, which may be drunk unfiltered (called apple cider in North America), or filtered. Filtered juice is often concentrated and frozen, then reconstituted later and consumed. Apple juice can be fermented to make cider (called hard cider in North America), ciderkin, and vinegar.[8] Through distillation, various alcoholic beverages can be produced, such as applejack, Calvados, and apple brandy.[8][87]\n",
      "### Organic production\n",
      "Organic apples are commonly produced in the United States.[88] Due to infestations by key insects and diseases, organic production is difficult in Europe.[89] The use of pesticides containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts (pyrethrum, neem) has been approved by the EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality.[89] A light coating of kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also may help prevent apple sun scalding.[48]\n",
      "### Non-browning apples\n",
      "Apple skins and seeds contain polyphenols.[90] These are oxidised by the enzyme polyphenol oxidase, which causes browning in sliced or bruised apples, by catalyzing the oxidation of phenolic compounds to o-quinones, a browning factor.[91] Browning reduces apple taste, color, and food value. Arctic apples, a non-browning group of apples introduced to the United States market in 2019, have been genetically modified to silence the expression of polyphenol oxidase, thereby delaying a browning effect and improving apple eating quality.[92][93] The US Food and Drug Administration in 2015, and Canadian Food Inspection Agency in 2017, determined that Arctic apples are as safe and nutritious as conventional apples.[94][95]\n",

      "![Illustration of girl in a red dress, holding 3 candles in one hand and a basket of apples in the other](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Carl_Larsson_Brita_as_Iduna.jpg/170px-Carl_Larsson_Brita_as_Iduna.jpg)\"Brita as Iduna\" (1901) by Carl Larsson\n",
      "In Norse mythology, the goddess Iðunn is portrayed in the _Prose Edda_ (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) as providing apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. The English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in _Skáldskaparmál_) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England.[97]\n",
      "Davidson notes a connection between apples and the Vanir, a tribe of gods associated with fertility in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven \"golden apples\" being given to woo the beautiful Gerðr by Skírnir, who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god Freyr in stanzas 19 and 20 of _Skírnismál_. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the _Völsunga saga_ : when the major goddess Frigg sends King Rerir an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a mound.[97] Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the birth (by Caesarean section) of their son—the hero Völsung.[98]\n",
      "Further, Davidson points out the \"strange\" phrase \"Apples of Hel\" used in an 11th-century poem by the skald Thorbiorn Brúnarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Brúnarson as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess Nehalennia is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the Roman Empire and came to Europe from the Near East, the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of Iðunn \"we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world.\"[97]\n",

      "Apples appear in many religious traditions, including Greek and Roman mythology where it has an ambiguous symbolism of discord, fertility, or courtship.[99] In Greek mythology, the Greek hero Heracles, as a part of his Twelve Labours, was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the Tree of Life growing at its center.[100]\n",
      "The Greek goddess of discord, Eris, became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of Peleus and Thetis.[101] In retaliation, she tossed a golden apple inscribed Καλλίστη (_Kallistē_ , \"For the most beautiful one\"), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Paris of Troy was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Sparta. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the Trojan War.[102][103]\n",
      "The apple was thus considered, in ancient Greece, sacred to Aphrodite. To throw an apple at someone was to symbolically declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to symbolically show one's acceptance of that love. An epigram claiming authorship by Plato states:[104]\n",
      "> I throw the apple at you, and if you are willing to love me, take it and share your girlhood with me; but if your thoughts are what I pray they are not, even then take it, and consider how short-lived is beauty.\n",
      "> — Plato, Epigram VII\n",
      "Atalanta, also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all but Hippomenes (also known as Melanion, a name possibly derived from _melon_ , the Greek word for both \"apple\" and fruit in general),[100] who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.[105][106]\n",
      "### Celtic mythology\n",
      "In Celtic mythology, the otherworld has many names, including _Emain Ablach_ , \"Emain of the Apple-trees\". A version of this is Avalon in Arthurian legend, or in Welsh _Ynys Afallon_ , \"Island of Apples\".[107]\n",

      "In China, apples symbolise peace, since the sounds of the first element (\"píng\") in the words \"apple\" (苹果, _Píngguǒ_) and \"peace\" (平安, _Píng'ān_) are homophonous in Mandarin and Cantonese.[3][108] When these two words are combined, the word _Píngānguǒ_ (平安果, \"Peace apples\") is formed. This association developed further as the name for Christmas Eve in Mandarin is _Píngānyè_ (平安夜, \"Peaceful/Quiet Evening\"), which made the gifting of apples at this season to friends and associates popular, as a way to wish them peace and safety.[108]\n",

      "Though the forbidden fruit of Eden in the Book of Genesis is not identified, popular Christian tradition has held that it was an apple that Eve coaxed Adam to share with her.[109] The origin of the popular identification with a fruit unknown in the Middle East in biblical times is found in wordplay with the Latin words _mālum_ (an apple) and _mălum_ (an evil), each of which is normally written _malum_.[110] The tree of the forbidden fruit is called \"the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\" in Genesis 2:17,[111] and the Latin for \"good and evil\" is _bonum et malum_.[112]\n",
      "Renaissance painters may also have been influenced by the story of the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides. As a result, in the story of Adam and Eve, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, the fall of man into sin, and sin itself. The larynx in the human throat has been called the \"Adam's apple\" because of a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit remaining in the throat of Adam. The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has been used to imply human sexuality, possibly in an ironic vein.[109]\n",
      "### Proverb\n",
      "The proverb, \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away\", addressing the supposed health benefits of the fruit, has been traced to 19th-century Wales, where the original phrase was \"Eat an apple on going to bed, and you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread\".[113] In the 19th century and early 20th, the phrase evolved to \"an apple a day, no doctor to pay\" and \"an apple a day sends the doctor away\"; the phrasing now commonly used was first recorded in 1922.[114]\n",

      "## Quick Start\n",
      "Here's a quick example to show you how easy it is to use Crawl4AI with its asynchronous capabilities:\n",
      "```\n",
      "import asyncio\n",
      "from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler\n",
      "async def main():\n",
      "  # Create an instance of AsyncWebCrawler\n",
      "  async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:\n",
      "    # Run the crawler on a URL\n",
      "    result = await crawler.arun(url=\"https://crawl4ai.com\")\n",
      "    # Print the extracted content\n",
      "    print(result.markdown)\n",
      "# Run the async main function\n",
      "asyncio.run(main())\n",

      "## What Does Crawl4AI Do?\n",
      "Crawl4AI is a feature-rich crawler and scraper that aims to:\n",
      "1. **Generate Clean Markdown** : Perfect for RAG pipelines or direct ingestion into LLMs. 2. **Structured Extraction** : Parse repeated patterns with CSS, XPath, or LLM-based extraction. 3. **Advanced Browser Control** : Hooks, proxies, stealth modes, session re-use—fine-grained control. 4. **High Performance** : Parallel crawling, chunk-based extraction, real-time use cases. 5. **Open Source** : No forced API keys, no paywalls—everyone can access their data. \n",
      "**Core Philosophies** : - **Democratize Data** : Free to use, transparent, and highly configurable. - **LLM Friendly** : Minimally processed, well-structured text, images, and metadata, so AI models can easily consume it.\n",
      "## Documentation Structure\n",
      "To help you get started, we’ve organized our docs into clear sections:\n",
      "  * **Setup & Installation** Basic instructions to install Crawl4AI via pip or Docker. \n",
      "  * **Quick Start** A hands-on introduction showing how to do your first crawl, generate Markdown, and do a simple extraction. \n",
      "  * **Core** Deeper guides on single-page crawling, advanced browser/crawler parameters, content filtering, and caching. \n",
      "  * **Advanced** Explore link & media handling, lazy loading, hooking & authentication, proxies, session management, and more. \n",
      "  * **Extraction** Detailed references for no-LLM (CSS, XPath) vs. LLM-based strategies, chunking, and clustering approaches. \n",
      "  * **API Reference** Find the technical specifics of each class and method, including `AsyncWebCrawler`, `arun()`, and `CrawlResult`.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout these sections, you’ll find code samples you can **copy-paste** into your environment. If something is missing or unclear, raise an issue or PR.\n",

      "By [Rob Wile](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/<https:/www.nbcnews.com/author/rob-wile-ncpn1293609>) and [Alexandra Byrne](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/<https:/www.nbcnews.com/author/alexandra-byrne-ncpn1310378>)\n",
      "Life under the Golden Arches hasn’t been easy this year.\n",
      "McDonald’s has faced a customer revolt over pricey Big Macs, an unsolicited cameo in election-season crossfire, and now an E. coli outbreak — just as the company had been luring customers back with more affordable burgers.\n",
      "Still, like U.S. consumers themselves, Mickey D’s remains in sturdy shape heading into 2025, despite its ongoing challenges.\n",
      "The fast-food giant [reported Tuesday](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/<https:/www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/mcdonalds-mcd-earnings-q3-2024.html>) that it had reversed its recent U.S. sales drop, posting a 0.3% uptick in the third quarter. Foot traffic was still down slightly, but the company said its summer of discounts was paying off.\n",
      "“We will stay laser-focused on providing an unparalleled experience with simple, everyday value and affordability that our consumers can count on as they continue to be mindful about their spending,” CEO Chris Kempczinski [said in a statement](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/<https:/www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mcdonalds-reports-third-quarter-2024-results-302289216.html?Fds-Load-Behavior=force-external>) alongside the earnings report.\n",
      "The financial results come toward the end of a humbling year for the nearly $213 billion restaurant chain, whose shares remained steady on the heels of its latest earnings. Kempczinski [sought to reassure investors](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/<https:/www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-ceo-comments.html>) that [the E. coli outbreak](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/<https:/www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/illnesses-linked-mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-rise-75-cdc-says-rcna177260>), linked to Quarter Pounder burgers, was under control after the health crisis temporarily dented the company’s stock and caused U.S. foot traffic to drop nearly 10% in the days afterward, according to estimates by Gordon Haskett financial researchers.\n",
      "“We view it as being behind us,” Kempczinski said on Tuesday’s earnings call.\n",
      "Despite a difficult quarter, McDonald’s looks resilient in the face of various pressures, analysts say — something the company shares with U.S. consumers overall.\n",
      "Relative to other major brands, like Starbucks, that have [struggled to reconnect with customers](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/<https:/www.cnbc.com/2024/10/22/starbucks-shares-slide-after-preliminary-results-show-sales-fell-again.html>) who are watching their wallets, McDonald’s has done an “excellent job” of bringing diners back, said Ravi Dhar, the director of Yale University’s Center for Customer Insights.\n",
      "“McDonald’s has also done a good job of embedding the brand in popular culture to enhance its relevance and meaning around fun and family. But it also needed to modify the product line to meet the expectations of a consumer who is on a tight budget,” he said.\n",
      "McDonald’s didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "For many consumers, the fast-food giant’s menus serve as an informal gauge of the economy overall, said Sara Senatore, a Bank of America analyst covering restaurants. “The spotlight is always on McDonald’s because it’s so big” and something of a “bellwether,” she said.\n",
      "That may be one reason it has cropped up in the presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris has touted the summer job she once held at the burger chain, looking to shore up her middle-class credentials. That spurred former President Donald Trump to [sling fries this month at a Philadelphia-area McDonald’s](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/<https:/www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-tries-troll-harris-serving-french-fries-mcdonalds-rcna176294>) in a photo op.\n",
      "Mickey D’s’ $5 meal deal, which it launched in late June to jumpstart slumping sales, has given the company an appealing price point to advertise nationwide, Senatore said, speculating that it could open the door to a new permanent value offering. But before that promotion rolled out, the company’s reputation as a low-cost option had taken a bruising hit.\n",
      "Like many major brands, McDonald’s raked in big profits as the economy reopened from the pandemic. In October 2022, [executives were boasting](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/<https:/www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/mcdonalds-mcd-earnings-q3-2022.html>) that they’d been raising prices without crimping traffic, even as competitors began to warn that some customers were closing their wallets after inflation peaked above 9% that summer. Still, the U.S. had repeatedly dodged a much-forecast recession, and [Americans kept spending on nonessentials](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/<https:/www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/year-peak-inflation-travel-leisure-mostly-cost-less-rcna92760>) like travel and dining out — despite regularly relaying to pollsters their dismal views of an otherwise solid economy.\n",
      "But by early this year, [photos of eye-watering menu prices](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/<https:/x.com/sam_learner/status/1681367351143301129>) at some McDonald’s locations — including an $18 Big Mac combo at a Connecticut rest stop from July 2023 — went viral, bringing diners’ long-simmering frustrations to a boiling point that the company couldn’t ignore. On an earnings call in April, Kempczinski acknowledged that foot traffic had fallen.\n",

      "“Consumers continue to be even more discriminating with every dollar that they spend,” he said at the time. Going forward, McDonald’s would be “laser-focused” on affordability. \n",

      "“The thing that McDonald’s had struggled with, and why I think we’re seeing kind of an inflection point, is a value proposition,” Senatore said. “McDonald’s menu price increases had run ahead of a lot of its restaurant peers. … Consumers are savvy enough to know that.”\n",
      "The company is far from the only one executing a course-correction, said Sam Oches, editorial director of the restaurant and food group at Informa, a market research firm. “Everyone has been trying to find solutions to the downward traffic trend all year,” he said.\n",
      "Landing on the right formula isn’t easy, Oches said, as it requires adjusting to shifts in consumer behavior that are still in flux: “Someone might be saying, ‘No more McDonald’s beverage treats today, I’ll eat at home — but maybe I’ll still get one tomorrow.’ But even a few visits less, over millions of people, has a big impact.”\n",
      "Senatore partly chalked up McDonald’s’ ability to tackle the problem to its sheer size, with over 14,000 locations in the U.S. alone. “I cannot overstate how important relative scale is in this industry,” she said. “They just have a much bigger bullhorn.”\n",
      "Other big bullhorn-welding companies have joined the price-cut bandwagon this year, fearful of their own customer defections or looking to address pullbacks already underway. Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Walgreens and JetBlue are just a handful of major consumer brands that have leaned into discounts this year. That reality still holds sway as consumers adjust to higher prices even as [the inflation fever has broken](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/<https:/www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/inflation-report-september-2024-cost-of-living-rcna174740>), with the pace of price hikes slowing last month to its lowest level since February 2021.\n",
      "Even so, 64% of consumers said they noticed price increases at quick-service restaurants in September, more than at any other type of venue, according to a survey by Datassential, a food and beverage market researcher. Politicians are still drawing attention to fast-food costs, too, as the election season barrels toward a tumultuous finish. A group of Democratic senators this month [denounced McDonald’s for menu prices](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/<https:/www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/democratic-senators-slam-mcdonalds-menu-price-hikes-rcna176380>) that they said outstripped inflation, accusing the company of looking to profit “at the expense of people’s ability to put food on the table.”\n",
      "In such a climate, analysts expect to see the discounts and promotions continue. “In a normalized environment, I don’t think you would see as much of an emphasis on value as we see right now,” said Jim Salera, a restaurant industry analyst for the financial firm Stephens.\n",
      "And so far, that play is largely working. [Retail sales rose 0.4%](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/<https:/www.cnbc.com/2024/10/17/retail-sales-rose-0point4percent-in-september-better-than-expected-jobless-claims-dip.html>) last month, better than expected.\n",
      "“September’s numbers show consumers are willing to spend where they see value,” Jack Kleinhenz, the National Retail Federation's chief economist, said in a statement. “Clearly, consumers continue to carry the economy, and conditions for the retail sector remain favorable as we move into the holiday season.”\n",
      "For McDonald’s, even [the E. Coli outbreak](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/<https:/www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mcdonalds-quarter-pounder-beef-patties-not-source-e-coli-outbreak-comp-rcna177516>) **—** which has sickened 75 people in 13 states and left one person dead**—** hasn’t shaken Wall Street’s faith in the company. Its stock has been on “a fairly volatile ride,” Senatore acknowledged, but is roughly flat since the start of the year. JPMorgan analysts recently said the company’s shares are “now trading on emotion/worry” and pointed to McDonald’s’ robust, flexible supply chain and strong momentum from the $5 meal.\n",
      "Whether these expectations bear out in the fourth quarter and into next year remains to be seen. But for now, the company is managing to tough it out.\n",
      "“They’re constantly fighting for attention, loyalty, trust, working on menu innovations, rolling out loyalty programs,” Oches said. “It’s a battle out there.”\n",
